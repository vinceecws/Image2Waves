# Waves2Faces
Work in progress! This project is for participation in the Art of Neuroscience competition. Basically, the aim is to recreate portraits of people by simulating EEG waveforms.

To give it a go, clone the repo, then all you need to start playing around with converting images to waveforms is `python image2waves.py [...args]`!

For information on the possible arguments, do `python image2waves.py -h`.

Enjoy!
